## Next Steps for Kaia Integration

### Ready for Implementation
1. **Chain Configuration**: Add Kaia (Chain ID 8217) to supported chains
2. **RPC Integration**: Configure Kaia RPC endpoints
3. **Protocol Adapters**: Test existing adapters with Kaia
4. **USDT Features**: Implement Kaia-native USDT functionality

### Foundation Benefits for Kaia
- **Modern Web3 stack**: Latest Wagmi/Viem for better chain support
- **Performance**: Faster builds and runtime for development
- **Stability**: Solid foundation for new feature development
- **Scalability**: Workspace structure supports growth

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: All upgrades tested and validated
- **Rollback Available**: Foundation-upgrade branch preserved
- **Breaking Changes**: Minimal, all addressed
- **Compatibility**: Maintained with existing features

## Conclusion
The foundation upgrade successfully modernized SNEL's tech stack while maintaining stability and performance. The codebase is now ready for Kaia integration with a solid, scalable foundation that follows all core principles.

**Estimated time saved for Kaia development**: 1-2 weeks due to improved tooling and resolved technical debt.
