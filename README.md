## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Redis (optional)

### Setup

1. Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sneldao/snel.git
cd snel

# Backend
cd backend && ./start.sh

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install
```

2. Configure environment:

```bash
# Create .env file with:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
ZEROX_API_KEY=your_0x_api_key
BRIAN_API_KEY=your_brian_api_key
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0  # Optional
```

3. Run development servers:

```bash
make dev  # Starts both backend and frontend
```

### Backend Start Script

The `start.sh` script in the backend directory automates the setup and running of the backend server:

```bash
cd backend && ./start.sh
```

This script:

- Creates a virtual environment if it doesn't exist
- Activates the virtual environment
- Installs all required dependencies (including python-dotenv)
- Creates a .env file from .env.example if needed
- Starts the uvicorn server

**Options:**

- Run with `--install-only` to only set up the environment without starting the server:
  ```bash
  ./start.sh --install-only
  ```

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you encounter dependency issues, the script will install core dependencies first
- The script handles common errors and provides helpful messages
- Always run the script from the backend directory

## 🌐 Deployment
