# Privacy Policy & Zcash Integration

## Overview

This document consolidates all privacy-related information for the Snel DeFi Assistant, including our approach to privacy, Zcash integration, and wallet recommendations.

## Zcash Wallet Recommendations

We recommend using wallets that are "shielded by default" to ensure maximum privacy:

### Mobile Wallets
1. **Zashi** (Recommended)
   - Official Zcash mobile wallet
   - Shielded by default
   - Platforms: iOS, Android
   - URL: https://zashi.app/

2. **YWallet**
   - Community-built mobile wallet for Zcash
   - Shielded by default
   - Platforms: iOS, Android
   - URL: https://ywallet.app/

### Desktop Wallets
1. **Nighthawk** (Recommended)
   - Open-source desktop wallet with full privacy support
   - Shielded by default
   - Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux
   - URL: https://nighthawkwallet.com/

### Multi-Asset Wallets
1. **Edge Wallet**
   - Multi-asset wallet with Zcash support

## Privacy Concepts

### Shielded Addresses (Private)
- Transaction details (addresses, amounts, memos) are hidden using zero-knowledge proofs
- Only you can see your transaction history

### Transparent Addresses (Public)
- Transaction details are visible on the blockchain, like Bitcoin or Ethereum
- Useful for regulatory compliance but less private

### Unified Address (UA)
- Modern Zcash address starting with "u"
- Works with all wallets and pools
- Automatically provides privacy with supporting wallets

## Privacy Bridge Guidance

When you bridge assets to Zcash through our platform:

1. **Confirm the Transaction**
   - Sign the bridge transaction in your wallet

2. **Wait for Confirmation**
   - Bridge typically completes in 5-10 minutes

3. **Get a Zcash Wallet**
   - Download Zashi (mobile) or Nighthawk (desktop) - both are shielded by default

4. **Receive Your Funds**
   - Your bridged assets will appear in your Zcash wallet automatically

5. **Use Privately**
   - Spend at merchants or send privately to others (visit paywithz.cash for merchant list)

## Security Tips

- Always use a wallet that is "shielded by default"
- Use unified addresses (UA) - they work with all wallets automatically
- Enable encrypted memos for private notes on transactions
- Avoid reusing the same address for different purposes to maintain anonymity
- Backup your seed phrase securely and keep it offline
- Verify wallet URLs carefully to avoid phishing

## Privacy FAQ

### What does it mean to "make assets private"?
You move your assets to Zcash, a blockchain where transactions are hidden. Your addresses, amounts, and transaction history are encrypted and visible only to you.

### Do I lose access to my assets?
No. Your assets move to Zcash and you receive them in a Zcash wallet (Zashi, Nighthawk, etc.). You maintain full control.

### What wallet do I need?
Use a wallet that is "shielded by default" like Zashi (mobile) or Nighthawk (desktop). These ensure your privacy features work correctly.

### Can I bridge back to Ethereum?
Yes. Exchanges like Gemini and Kraken support Zcash trading. You can sell on an exchange and bridge back if needed.

### How long does bridging take?
Typically 5-10 minutes. The bridge uses Axelar's secure cross-chain protocol.

### Is this legal?
Yes. Privacy is a legitimate financial right. However, regulations vary by jurisdiction - check local laws.
