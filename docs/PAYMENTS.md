# Payments & Transactions

## X402 Agentic Payment Integration

### Overview

X402 is Cronos' protocol for AI-triggered payments and automated settlement workflows. SNEL integrates x402 naturally into conversations, following the same pattern as MNEE payments.

### Core Features

- **AI-Triggered Payments**: Autonomous payments executed by AI agents based on conditions
- **EIP-712 Authorization**: Secure cryptographic signatures for payment delegation  
- **Gasless Transactions**: EIP-7702 delegation for reduced transaction costs
- **Automated Settlement**: Recurring and scheduled payment workflows
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple payments in single transaction for efficiency
- **Agent-to-Agent Transactions**: Direct AI-to-AI settlement without human intervention

### Natural Language Commands

```bash
# AI Agent Payments
"pay agent 10 USDC for API calls"
"send 5 CRO to agent.eth for processing"

# Recurring Payments
"setup weekly payment of 100 USDC to supplier.eth"
"create monthly payment of 50 CRO to contractor.eth"

# Batch Settlements
"process batch settlement for suppliers"
"execute batch payment to contractors"
```

### Network Support

- **Cronos Mainnet** (Chain ID: 25)
- **Cronos Testnet** (Chain ID: 338)

When users attempt x402 commands on other networks, SNEL naturally suggests switching to Cronos.

### Integration Architecture

X402 follows the same natural integration pattern as MNEE:

1. **Contextual Discovery**: Mentioned in capability discussions
2. **Network-Aware Suggestions**: Prompts to switch to Cronos when needed
3. **Natural Language Processing**: Commands parsed conversationally
4. **Knowledge Base Integration**: Full protocol information available

### User Experience Flow

```
User: "what can you do?"
SNEL: "I support MNEE commerce payments and X402 agentic payments on Cronos..."

User: "pay agent 10 USDC"
SNEL: [If not on Cronos] "X402 agentic payments are available on Cronos EVM! Switch to..."
SNEL: [If on Cronos] "🤖 AI Agent Payment Ready - Amount: 10 USDC..."
```

## Payment Actions System (Phase 1)

User-customizable payment actions with guided chat-based creation and personalization.

### Architecture

**Unified Data Model**: Single `PaymentAction` replaces templates, recipients, and shortcuts.
- `actionType`: send | recurring | template | shortcut
- `isPinned`: Show in quick action buttons (max 5)
- `usageCount`, `lastUsed`: Track usage patterns
- `schedule`: Optional recurring configuration

**Storage**:
- **Frontend**: localStorage (`snel_payment_actions_{walletAddress}`)
- **Backend**: In-memory service (PaymentActionService), ready for Redis/DB upgrade

### User Flow

1. **Create**: "create payment action" → 7-step guided chat flow
2. **Display**: Pinned actions appear as quick buttons (max 5)
3. **Execute**: Click action or say "use action {name}"
4. **Manage**: "show my payment actions", "update {action}", "delete {action}"

### For Developers

**Create Action**:
```typescript
const action = await service.createPaymentAction(walletAddress, {
  name: "Weekly Rent",
  actionType: "recurring",
  recipientAddress: "0x742d...",
  amount: "1.5",
  token: "ETH",
  chainId: 1,
  schedule: { frequency: "weekly", dayOfWeek: 1 },
  isPinned: true,
});
```

**Get Quick Actions**:
```typescript
const quickActions = await service.getQuickActions(walletAddress);
// Returns max 5 pinned actions, sorted by usage
```

**Files**:
- Backend: `backend/app/domains/payment_actions/{models,service}.py`
- Backend: `backend/app/services/processors/payment_action_processor.py`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/services/paymentHistoryService.ts`

3. **Build** - Construct transaction with MNEE adapter
4. **Sign** - Await wallet signature (pluggable signing function)
5. **Submit** - Send to MNEE API, receive ticket ID
6. **Track** - Monitor status via MNEE ticket system

**New Commands**:
```
User: "execute action rent"
→ Validates action
→ Builds transaction
→ Returns quote + awaits signature

User: "check payment status {ticket_id}"
→ Queries MNEE API ticket status
→ Returns confirmed/pending/failed status

User: "validate action coffee"
→ Pre-flight checks without execution
→ Returns warnings and errors
```

**ExecutionResult States**:
- QUEUED → BUILDING → AWAITING_SIGNATURE → SUBMITTED → PROCESSING → COMPLETED
- FAILED (at any stage with error message)

**Transaction History**:
- Records all executed payments with MNEE ticket IDs
- Tracks confirmations, fees, and on-chain hashes

   - Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) for fuzzy matches
   - Word overlap detection
   - Character-level similarity (SequenceMatcher)
   - Trigger suggestion generator

2. **Smart Suggestions** (suggestions.py):
   - Usage-based ranking (frequency + recency)
   - Time-based context (weekdays vs weekends, hours)
   - Overdue recurring payment detection
   - Intelligent scoring: recent (0.4) + frequent (0.4) + pinned (0.2)

3. **Recurring Scheduler** (scheduler.py):
   - Daily, weekly, monthly frequency support
   - Day-of-week and day-of-month targeting
   - Due/overdue status calculation
   - Upcoming payment forecasting
   - Human-readable descriptions

→ Shows matching action with confidence score
→ Ready to execute

User: "what should i pay today?"
→ Suggestion engine analyzes usage patterns
→ Returns: "Frequent Payment (score=0.95), Weekly Payment (score=0.82)"

User: "show my upcoming payments"
→ Scheduler checks all recurring actions
→ Returns due + upcoming in next 7 days

User: "create a daily reminder for coffee"
→ Sets DAILY frequency
→ Trigger includes "coffee"
→ Scheduler monitors for execution
```

**Test Coverage**: 12 tests, 100% passing
- Trigger matching: exact, substring, fuzzy
- Trigger suggestions: by action type
- Suggestions by usage: frequency + recency scoring
- Suggestions by time: context-aware
- Scheduler: daily, weekly, monthly payments

### Phase 5: AI Agent Webhooks & Batch Payments

**Complete**: Webhook endpoints for AI agents + batch payments with revenue splits + automatic keeper job

**Architecture**: Three webhook endpoints + batch split calculation + recurring execution scheduler

**New Features**:

1. **AI Agent Payment Webhooks**:
   ```
   POST /api/webhooks/execute-action
   - Agent triggers payment programmatically
   - HMAC signature validation (production-ready)
   - Execution tracking with request IDs
   
   Example: AI agent pays for data
   Agent → Webhook → Execute action → MNEE transfer → Ticket returned
   ```

2. **Batch Payments with Splits**:
   ```
   POST /api/webhooks/execute-batch
   - Multiple recipients in single call
   - Percentage-based distribution (60%, 40%)
   - Or fixed amounts (10, 20, 30)
   - Audit trail for all splits
   
   Example: Creator platform pays 3 creators
   100 MNEE → Split to 3 wallets → Each gets their share
   ```

3. **Automatic Recurring Execution**:
   ```
   Keeper Job (scheduler service)
   - Runs hourly/daily/on-demand
   - Finds all due recurring payments
   - Executes automatically
   - Tracks execution history
   
   Example: Monthly subscriptions auto-execute on schedule
   ```

**New Files**:
- `backend/app/domains/payment_actions/webhooks.py` - Webhook models, signature validation
- `backend/app/services/webhook_service.py` - Event processing, batch split logic

**Enhanced Files**:
- `backend/app/domains/payment_actions/models.py` - Added `PaymentRecipient` + batch support
- `backend/app/domains/payment_actions/storage.py` - Added `list_wallets()` method to all backends
- `backend/app/domains/payment_actions/service.py` - Added `get_all_wallets()` for keeper
- `backend/app/main.py` - Registered webhook + keeper routers

**New Commands** (via Webhook):
```
# Execute existing action
POST /api/webhooks/execute-action
{"action_id": "rent", "wallet_address": "0x...", "override_amount": "100"}

# Batch payout
POST /api/webhooks/execute-batch
{
  "recipients": [
    {"address": "0xA...", "percentage": 60},
    {"address": "0xB...", "percentage": 40}
  ]
}

# Create action via API
POST /api/webhooks/create-action
{"name": "Monthly rent", "amount": "500", ...}

# Manual keeper trigger
POST /api/v1/keeper/run-check

# Scheduled keeper
python scripts/run_keeper.py --scheduler hourly
```

**Test Cases**:
- Webhook signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
- Batch split calculation (percentages → amounts)
- Recurring due detection (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Execution history tracking
- Error handling + retry logic

**Hackathon Focus**:

# - Metadata (price, collateral, regulation info)
```

#### Transaction Building

Build transactions ready for signing:
```python
txn = await adapter.build_transaction(
    quote=quote,
    chain_id=236,
    from_address="sender_address",
    to_address="recipient_address"
)
# Returns:
# {

## Transaction Processing & Error Handling

### Swap Service Critical Fixes (Jan 7, 2026)

#### Issues Fixed

**1. Swap Route Discovery Broken**
- **Problem**: User requests "swap 1 usdc for eth" → Error: "No swap route found"
- **Root Cause**: Method name mismatch in protocol registry (`get_swap_quote()` → `get_quote()`)
- **Impact**: Swap service completely non-functional
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

**2. Wallet Connection Blocked**
- **Problem**: Browser console "origins don't match" errors, wallet injection fails
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded origin URL doesn't match dynamic deployment
- **Impact**: Users cannot connect wallets or sign transactions
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

**3. Brian API Shutdown**
- **Problem**: Brian Protocol ceased operations, APIs shutting down in 3 months
- **Impact**: Fallback protocol no longer available
- **Status**: ✅ REMOVED (consolidated routing to 0x + Uniswap)

### Swap Routing (Updated)
- **Single-chain**: 0x (best rates) → Uniswap V3 (reliable)
- **Cross-chain**: Circle CCTP V2 (USDC) → Axelar (other tokens)

### Knowledge Base Architecture Improvements

#### Overview

Refactored protocol knowledge base into a modular, structured system with dynamic metrics, analytics, and relationship mapping.

#### 1. Structured ProtocolEntry Schema

**File**: `backend/app/services/knowledge_base/models.py`

Pydantic-based schema enforcement instead of arbitrary dicts.

**Required Fields:**
- `official_name` - Full protocol name
- `type` - Category (dex, bridge, stablecoin, etc.)
- `summary` - One-line description
- `key_features` - List of main features

**Organized Optional Fields:**
- **Concept**: privacy_explanation, technical_explanation, how_it_works
- **Finance**: governance_token, launch_date, tokenomics
- **Security**: audits (firm, date, status), security_info
- **Infrastructure**: contracts (chain → address mapping), recommended_wallets
- **Relationships**: integrations_with, bridges_to, competes_with
- **Localization**: names (en, es, zh)
- **Metadata**: last_verified, source_url, from_knowledge_base

#### 2. Alias Support

```python
"mnee": {
    "aliases": ["mnee token", "mnee stablecoin"],
    ...
}
"zcash": {
    "aliases": ["zec", "zcash protocol"],
    ...
}
```

- Fast exact-match lookup on aliases (no fuzzy matching overhead)
- Handles common name variations automatically
- Example: "What is uni?" → matches "uniswap"

#### 3. Dynamic Metrics Layer

**File**: `backend/app/services/knowledge_base/models.py` (ProtocolMetrics)

Separate from static KB (single responsibility principle).

**Fields:**
- tvl, volume_24h, market_cap, apy_yield, fees
- last_updated, source

**Benefits:**
- Can be cached from Firecrawl scrapes (auto-enrichment)
- Enables queries like "What's MNEE's TVL?" without re-scraping
- Metrics updated independently of static KB

#### 4. Query Analytics

- Tracks all KB lookups that miss (queries without a match)
- `get_top_misses(limit=20)` returns most-searched missing protocols
- Data-driven KB expansion: "Which protocols should we add next?"
- Logged with protocol name and frequency

#### 5. Protocol Relationships

```python
"mnee": {
    "integrations_with": ["uniswap", "aave", "curve"],
    "bridges_to": ["ethereum", "polygon", "base"],
    "competes_with": ["usdc", "usdt", "dai"],
}
```

- Enables: "Find protocols that integrate with MNEE"
- Enables: "What are MNEE's alternatives?"
- Reduces dependency on external search

#### 6. Multi-Language Support

```python
"names": {
    "en": "MNEE Stablecoin",
    "es": "Moneda Estable MNEE",
    "zh": "MNEE稳定币"
}
```

- Handles queries in Spanish, Mandarin, etc.
- Extensible to any language
- Used by research endpoints for localized responses

#### 7. Auto-Enrichment from Firecrawl

```python
kb.update_metrics(protocol_name, metrics)
```

- When Firecrawl scrapes a protocol, extracted metrics are cached
- Next query reuses cached data (no re-scrape)
- Timestamp tracks freshness
- Single source of truth: KB is enriched by research

#### 8. Singleton KB Service

```python
from app/services/knowledge_base import get_protocol_kb
kb = get_protocol_kb()
kb_result = kb.get("mnee")  # Returns (matched_key, entry)
kb.update_metrics("mnee", metrics)
misses = kb.get_top_misses(20)
```

- Central access point, no scattered imports
- Manages all KB operations
- Dependency injection ready

### Test Results

#### ✅ Null-Safety
```
Input: Completely unparseable command with null details
Output: Safe error response with guidance (NO CRASH)
Status: PASS
```

#### ✅ KB Enrichment
```
Input: "swap eth to mnee" (missing amount)
Output: Error message enhanced with MNEE Stablecoin info:
  - Official name
  - Summary
  - Available chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum)
  - Integrations (Uniswap, Aave, Curve)
Status: PASS
```

#### ✅ Alias Matching
```
Input: Token alias "zec"
Output: Resolves to "zcash" entry in KB
Status: PASS
```

#### ✅ Miss Tracking
```
Input: Unknown token "fakecoin123"
Output: Logged as KB miss for analytics
Status: PASS
```

#### ✅ Swap Service (Post-Fix)
```
Input: "swap 1 usdc for eth" on Ethereum
Output: Quote with 0x protocol, estimated output, price impact
Status: PASS (fixed Jan 7)
```

### Architecture Benefits

✅ **ENHANCEMENT FIRST** - No new modules, enhanced existing ones
✅ **AGGRESSIVE CONSOLIDATION** - Unified error flow, removed duplication
✅ **PREVENT BLOAT** - Structured schema, no arbitrary fields
✅ **DRY** - KB is single source of truth for token metadata
✅ **CLEAN** - Clear separation: null check → KB lookup → enriched response
✅ **MODULAR** - KB operations isolated and testable
✅ **PERFORMANT** - Alias matching faster than fuzzy, metrics cached
✅ **ORGANIZED** - Domain-driven processor pattern, knowledge_base/ domain

**Deleted Files: 2 (IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, KNOWLEDGE_BASE_IMPROVEMENTS.md)**

### Backward Compatibility

✅ All changes are additive (no breaking changes)
✅ Existing error handlers still work
✅ KB lookups gracefully degrade if token not found
✅ Frontend error formatting has fallbacks
✅ Swap service works with only 2 adapters (0x, Uniswap)

### Known Limitations & Future Work

#### Current Limitations
1. **Swap Routing** - No longer has Brian fallback, only 0x and Uniswap (sufficient for most cases)
2. **API Keys** - Requires ZEROX_API_KEY and Alchemy/Infura keys to be functional
3. **Token Resolution** - Relies on token service for unknown tokens (may have delays)

#### Future Enhancements (Ready to Build)

1. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - View `kb.get_top_misses()` to see frequently searched tokens
   - Data-driven KB expansion priorities

2. **One-Click Retry**
   - Frontend buttons: "Try 'swap 1 eth for MNEE on Polygon'"
   - Leverages KB chains/integrations data

3. **Token Discovery Flow**
   - "Learn more about MNEE?" → Research flow integration
   - Links to external resources (CoinGecko, Etherscan, etc.)

4. **Multi-Language Support**
   - KB already has `names` field for ES/ZH
   - Just needs frontend language detection

5. **Smart Suggestions**
   - "Competing with USDC, USDT, DAI?" → Show alternatives
   - Uses KB's `competes_with` field

6. **Additional Protocol Adapters**
   - CowSwap, Paraswap, 1inch for better routing
   - CCTP for more cross-chain pairs

### Status: PRODUCTION READY ✅

All critical issues resolved, core functionality working, architecture clean and extensible.   - Can process MNEE payment commands

#### Communication Gaps Identified:

1. **Limited Context Awareness**:
   - AI doesn't understand MNEE's role in commerce ecosystem
   - Lacks knowledge of MNEE's relationship to other payment methods

2. **Onboarding Experience**:
   - New users unaware of MNEE's specific use cases
   - No clear guidance on when to use MNEE vs other tokens

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Unclear feedback when MNEE operations fail
   - No fallback suggestions for MNEE-specific issues

#### Improvement Recommendations:

1. **Enhanced AI Training**:
   - Add MNEE-specific context to AI prompt system
   - Include MNEE use cases in agent knowledge base

2. **Improved Onboarding**:
   - Add MNEE-specific onboarding flow
   - Create MNEE use case examples in UI

3. **Better Error Messages**:
   - Implement MNEE-specific error handling
   - Provide clear fallback options
